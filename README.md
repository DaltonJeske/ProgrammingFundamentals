Programming Fundamentals was centered around Javascript. I think the attached final project does an excellent job of encapsulating what was learned. I love Pokemon and I decided to center my project around that. I developed code that would allow you to search for any of the original 151 Pokemon. The program would then return the Pokemon name, Pokedex number, type(s), and stats. This was quite challenging for me as I had to manually input 151 Pokemon and there matching information. I also had to make a loop that would recognize the user input and return the matching Pokemon. This was a challenging and rewarding final project to cap off my first semester of learning how to code! The code can be found in the zip file attached to this repository.
